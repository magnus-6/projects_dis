## Introduction
This project aims to develop a robust anti-spoofing detection system that can accurately distinguish between genuine and spoofed images. The primary goal is to create a software solution that maintains high performance across various conditions by leveraging a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to enhance accuracy. Additionally, the project implements a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) and a software-to-hardware implementation on a Raspberry Pi 5 to ensure applicability in real-world scenarios.
